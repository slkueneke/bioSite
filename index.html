              Fritzie Dizon is a woman of vision, heart, and drive. Her goals are rooted in self-improvement, compassion, and service. Every day, she strives to be her best self — mentally, emotionally, and physically — believing that growth and balance are essential for both personal fulfillment and meaningful impact. As a devoted dog mom, one of her goals is to provide a loving and enriching life for her furry companion. She dreams of owning a house with a spacious yard where her current dog and a future second pup can run freely and happily.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fritzie also aims to give more of her time and energy to volunteering. She understands the importance of community support and seeks to play a greater role in helping others through consistent, hands-on service. Traveling is another aspiration, as she believes that exploring different cultures and perspectives enriches both the mind and spirit. Ultimately, Fritzie’s long-term professional goal is to become the president of a nonprofit foundation — a role where she can combine her leadership skills, nonprofit expertise, and deep desire to create lasting social change.
