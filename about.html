          <p>Fritzie, born in 1984, was raised in San Diego, California, alongside her two sisters and parents. She attended Mount Carmel High School and later pursued a bachelor's degree in Environmental Analysis and Design at the University of California, Irvine. After graduating, she accepted a temporary position at UC San Diego in donor outreach and developmentâ€”a role that would shape the course of her professional life. Discovering a passion for fundraising and nonprofit work, Fritzie remained in the development field, building a meaningful career.</p>

          <p>In 2013, Fritzie made a bold move across the country to New York City to advance both her education and career. She enrolled at Columbia University, where she earned her master's degree while continuing to work in non-profit management. Her role eventually expanded to include leadership in gift planning as well, and she served as a director at the university until 2021.</p>

          <p>After a decade in New York, Fritzie decided to return to her hometown of San Diego to be closer to her family and longtime friends. Reestablishing her roots, she settled into downtown San Diego and adopted a rescue dog named Clementine, who quickly became her beloved companion. Fritzie now enjoys a fulfilling life, spending time with her niece and four nephews and balancing her career in gift planning at University of Southern California with personal passions and community involvement.</p>
